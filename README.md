# ✍️ Sign Forgery Detection System

A Python-based **Sign Forgery Detection System** that uses image processing techniques to analyze and detect forged signatures.  
This project was created as part of my journey in learning **Python** and **OpenCV**, focusing on real-world applications of computer vision.

## 🚀 Features

- 📄 Upload and compare signatures  
- 🧠 Image analysis using OpenCV  
- 🔍 Detects possible forgery based on similarity metrics  
- 💾 Stores signature records for future reference  
- 🎨 Simple UI (can be extended using Flask or Tkinter)  
- ⚙️ Modular and easy-to-understand Python codebase
